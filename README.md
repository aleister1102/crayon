# Crayon

A Burp Suite extension that automatically colorizes request/response entries in the Proxy history and other tools, making it easier to spot interesting items at a glance.

## Features

Crayon uses a set of predefined and configurable rules to apply highlight colors:

**Requests:**
*   `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`: Yellow
*   `DELETE`: Red

**Responses (by Status Code):**
*   **5xx Server Error:** Red
*   **4xx Client Error:** Orange
*   **3xx Redirection:** Yellow

**Responses (by Content-Type for 2xx Status):**
*   **JSON:** Green (Configurable)
*   **XML:** Blue (Configurable)
*   **HTML:** Magenta (Configurable)

## Configuration

You can customize the colors for different content types and enable/disable logging via the "Crayon Settings" panel in the Burp Suite **Settings** dialog.

## Building the extension
